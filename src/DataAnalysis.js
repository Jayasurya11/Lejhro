        <h3>Data Analysis: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
        <h6>
          Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering
          out onto the web like deer on a freeway.
        </h6>
        <h6> ~ Geoffrey Moore</h6>
        <p>
          Companies today need every edge and advantage they can get. Thanks to
          obstacles like rapidly changing markets, economic uncertainty, finicky
          consumer attitudes, and even global pandemics, businesses today are
          working with slimmer margins for error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies that want to thrive in these competitive markets can improve
          their odds of success with the help of data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This strategy is common sense, and it applies to personal life as well
          as business. No one makes important decisions without first finding
          out what's at stake, the pros and cons, and the possible outcomes.
          Similarly, no company that wants to succeed should make decisions
          based on bad data. Organisations need information; they need data.
          This is where data analysis enters the picture.
        </p>
        <h6>What is data analysis?</h6>
        <p>
          Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and
          modelling data to discover useful information for business
          decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful
          information from data and take the decision based upon the data
          analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information gathered from the data are then presented visually in
          the form of charts, graphs, or dashboards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information discovered can help aid the company's or
          organisation's growth. Decision-makers will be able to come to an
          actionable conclusion and make the right business decisions.
        </p>
        <h6>Types of Data Analysis:</h6>
        <h6>Text Analysis</h6>
        <p>
          Text Analysis is also referred to as Data Mining. It is one of the
          methods of data analysis to discover a pattern in large data sets
          using databases or data mining tools. It used to transform raw data
          into business information.
        </p>
        <h6>Descriptive Analysis</h6>
        <p>
          The descriptive analysis method is the starting point to any analytic
          reflection, and it aims to answer the question of what happened? It
          does this by ordering, manipulating, and interpreting raw data from
          various sources to turn it into valuable insights for your
          organisation.
        </p>
        <h6>Exploratory Analysis</h6>
        <p>
          As its name suggests, the main aim of the exploratory analysis is to
          explore. Prior to it, there was still no notion of the relationship
          between the data and the variables. Once the data is investigated, the
          exploratory analysis enables you to find connections and generate
          hypotheses and solutions for specific problems.
        </p>
        <h6>Statistical Analysis</h6>
        <p>
          Statistical Analysis shows “What happened?” by using past data in the
          form of dashboards. Statistical Analysis includes collection,
          Analysis, interpretation, presentation, and modelling of data. It
          analyses a set of data or a sample of data.
        </p>
        <h6>Predictive analysis</h6>
        <p>
          The predictive method allows you to look into the future to answer the
          question: what will happen? In order to do this, it uses the results
          of the previously mentioned descriptive, exploratory, and diagnostic
          analysis, in addition to machine learning (ML) and artificial
          intelligence (AI). Like this, you can uncover future trends, potential
          problems or inefficiencies, connections, and casualties in your data.
        </p>
        <h6>Diagnostic Analysis</h6>
        <p>
          Diagnostic Analysis shows “Why did it happen?” by finding the cause
          from the insight found in Statistical Analysis. This Analysis is
          useful to identify behaviour patterns of data. If a new problem
          arrives in your business process, then you can look into this Analysis
          to find similar patterns of that problem. And it may have chances to
          use similar prescriptions for the new problems.
        </p>
        <h6>Data Analysis Process</h6>
        <p>
          The Data Analysis Process is gathering information by using a proper
          application or tool which allows you to explore the data and find a
          pattern in it.
        </p>
        <p>It has following phases:</p>
        <h6>Identify:</h6>
        <p>
          You first need to identify why you need it in the first place. The
          identification is the stage in which you establish the questions you
          will need to answer. For example, what is the customer's perception of
          our brand? Or what type of packaging is more engaging to our potential
          customers? Once the questions are outlined you are ready for the next
          step.
        </p>
        <h6>Collect:</h6>
        <p>
          This is the stage where you start collecting the needed data. Here,
          you define which sources of information you will use and how you will
          use them. The collection of data can come in different forms such as
          internal or external sources, surveys, interviews, questionnaires,
          focus groups, among others.
        </p>
        <h6>Cleaning:</h6>
        <p>
          Now whatever data is collected may not be useful or irrelevant to your
          aim of Analysis, hence it should be cleaned. The data which is
          collected may contain duplicate records, white spaces or errors. The
          data should be cleaned and error free. This phase must be done before
          Analysis because based on data cleaning, your output of Analysis will
          be closer to your expected outcome.
        </p>
        <h6>Analysis:</h6>
        <p>
          Once the data is collected, cleaned, and processed, it is ready for
          Analysis. As you manipulate data, you may find you have the exact
          information you need, or you might need to collect more data. During
          this phase, you can use data analysis tools and software which will
          help you to understand, interpret, and derive conclusions based on the
          requirements.
        </p>
        <h6>Interpretation:</h6>
        <p>
          After analysing your data, it’s finally time to interpret your
          results. You can choose the way to express or communicate your data
          analysis either you can use simply in words or maybe a table or chart.
        </p>
        <h6>Visualisation:</h6>
        <p>
          Data visualisation is very common in your day to day life; they often
          appear in the form of charts and graphs. In other words, data shown
          graphically so that it will be easier for the human brain to
          understand and process it.
